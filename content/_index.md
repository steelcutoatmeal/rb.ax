Hello, I'm Ryan Bagley. I'm a [network engineer](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-is-a-network-engineer), documentarian, and hobbyist writer living in the American West.

I work at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/), which sometimes eats up a lot of my free time. But that is frequently my own doing since I'm part of an awesome team and work on fascinating projects.

I enjoy photographing and writing about my adventures. There is a lot to see in the world but I enjoy sharing the little snippets I have experienced.

If you enjoy thoughtful articles and some neat pictures from a guy running around in the wilderness then check out my [blog](/blog) or subscribe to the [RSS](/atom.xml) feed.
