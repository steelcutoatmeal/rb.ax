Hello, I'm Ryan Bagley. I'm a [documentarian](/tags/), [network engineer](/tags/networking/), and [trail runner](/tags/running/) living in the American West. I enjoy sharing my adventures and learning process. The result is this little blog.

I work at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/), which eats up a lot of my free time but I'm part of a great team and work on fascinating projects. For an unlimited supply of neat pictures and average writing then check out the [blog](/blog/) or [RSS](/atom.xml) feed.
