I'm good at avoiding social engagements. It is all the easier when you have a hobby that can take you far away into the wilderness. On Easter Weekend I put this expertise into play and ended up touring a portion of the San Rafael Swell Recreation Area located in central Utah.

Many people end up at the majestic cliffs dubbed *The Wedge* in the northern part of the Swell. But there is a great deal more to see. I had previously visited [Black Dragon Canyon]() and The Wedge, which were each beautiful in their own unique ways. Yet there could be more beauty out there and I was going to find it.

I approached the Swell from the north through Price. I took highway 10 south and diverted to the Green River Cutoff Road. This eventually led to Buckhorn Draw Road that squiggles and descends through the majestic canyon next to The Wedge. 

There are many camp sites along the canyon and many could provide beautiful sunset or sunrise pictures. The canyon extends at a diagonal from the north west to the south east. This would allow for a dramatic contrast of sunlight. But there was a lot of time left in the day and I continued on southward into the swell.

After crossing the San Rafael River the land opened to the desert and plateaus. There are many branching roads in this section. Around Calf Mesa and down Cane Wash, Oil Well Flat, or Road Hollow. All trails looked inspiring but I was aiming for a timid trip. My 4Runner had gone under the knife the week prior with new suspension and tires. I was re-learning my truck and what was rubbing where. Not the best time to push my limits.

I stuck to the timid Buckhorn Draw Road until around *[The Sinkhole](https://goo.gl/maps/xkNrHCqBp73dgJQZ8)* near I-70. I forked off here to the Rattlesnake Flat area and found a [dispersed campsite in an area](https://goo.gl/maps/vhVouhkFJetHhQC26) covered by shrubby cedar trees.

There was a cellular radio tower on the nearby plateau, which gave me the best 5G connection I've ever experienced. I'm sure me and the other 3 people connected to the tower were barely pushing 1% of capacity. I took the opportunity to check in with my wife with a seamless video chat.
