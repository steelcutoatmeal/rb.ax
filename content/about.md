So, uh, you already read my elevator pitch on the home page but I guess you want to know more. I live in the Salt Lake City, Utah area with my wife and two dogs. If I'm not working I am usually trying to entertain 1 or more of the previously mentioned mammals.

My childhood was spread across the United States but I was fortunate enough to have parents that valued being outdoors. This usually resulted in several camping trips each year. The impressions about being in nature certainly stayed with me and I have been trying to reintegrate that into my life as an adult. Much of the content I draft on this site is driven by my literary and visual appreciation of the American West.
